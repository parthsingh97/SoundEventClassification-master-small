mergedActivities = ['Drinking', 'Eating', 'LyingDown', 'OpeningPillContainer', 
                          'PickingObject', 'Reading', 'SitStill', 'Sitting', 'Sleeping', 
                          'StandUp', 'UseLaptop', 'UsingPhone', 'WakeUp', 'Walking', 
                          'WaterPouring', 'Writing']
    
specificActivities = ['Calling', 'Clapping', 'Falling', 'Sweeping', 'WashingHand', 'WatchingTV']
    
enteringExiting = ['Entering', 'Exiting']


During training 
1. elements of 'specificActivities' have their respective labels. So, 'Calling' would have the label 'Calling' and so on. 

2. both the elements of enteringExiting have the same label 'enteringExiting'

3. all the elements of mergedActivities have the same label 'other'
